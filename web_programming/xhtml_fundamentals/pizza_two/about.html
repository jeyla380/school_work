				<div class="describe-index">
					<p>Founded in the early 1950s, the De Luca family created a unique pizza business along the Avenues in Salt Lake City, Utah; which is where the resturant got it's name. It is a place where customers tell us what they want, not what is only on the menu. This is the place where families, friends, individuals can come and order the best pizza in Salt Lake. Over the years we have adapted our recipes so anyone, including those with specific dietary needs, can still enjoy our pizzas just as the next person.</p>
