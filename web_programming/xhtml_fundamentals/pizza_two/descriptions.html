							<h3>Thin Crusts</h3>
								<div>
								<h4>Flatbread/Focaccia</h4>
									<p>Flatbread and focaccia bread pizzas are commonly seen served in bistros, cafes, and restaurants that emphasize small-bites menus. A popular misconception with this style of pizza is that it is part of some “new wave” style or trend in pizza-dom. In fact, flatbread pizza can be thought of as one of the first styles of pizza ever eaten, with some records accounting for this style of pizza being employed by the ancient Egyptians as well as the ancient Greeks and Romans. Pretty cool! <br><br> A focaccia style crust is a type of flatbread pizza that puts emphasis on the focaccia breads airiness and garlic notes. A focaccia style crust is great due to its end pieces acting as perfect dipping sticks once you finish eating a piece, as the light, airy texture resemble breadsticks.</p>

								<div>
								<h4>New York</h4>
									<p>With its characteristic large, foldable slices and crispy outer crust, New York-style pizza is one of America’s most famous regional pizza types. Originally a variation of Neapolitan-style pizza, the New York slice has taken on a fame all its own, with some saying its unique flavor has to do with the minerals present in New York’s tap water supply. <br><br> New York-style pizza usually features tomato sauce and mozzarella cheese. Unlike its thin crust counterpart, the Neapolitan, New York-style pizzas can handle a wide range of additional toppings, from pepperoni and sausage to mushroom and anchovies. While this style of pizza can have virtually any topping added to it, it's common to find pizza lovers topping New York pizza with condiments, like oregano, red pepper flakes, Parmesan cheese, and garlic powder. </p>
								</div>
								<div>
								<h4>New Haven</h4>
									<p>The New Haven style pizza, known to locals as “apizza” is very different from what you’d expect from the typically floppy east coast pizza. For one, it is typically shaped irregularly – neither a perfect sphere or rectangle, which is a result of the how the extremely thin dough is carefully spread out before baking in a ripping hot coal-fired oven. The crust is arguably the thinnest on this list, and quite crunchy, however don’t mistake it for being brittle – the lightning fast cook time at high temperature ensures a delicious char without drying out the dough too much.</p>
								</div>
								<div>
								<h4>St. Louis</h4>
									<p>Looking for a light slice? St. Louis pizza features a thin crust with a cracker-like consistency that is made without yeast. Due to the crispy crust, St. Louis pizza is usually cut into three- or four-inch rectangles, known as "party" or "tavern" cut. This pizza features Provel processed cheese, which is a gooey combination of cheddar, Swiss, and provolone cheeses. St. Louis received an influx of Italian immigrants in the 19th century who were looking for employment opportunities. The Italian community, largely from Milan and Sicily, created the St. Louis-style pizza. Its sweet sauce is reminiscent of the Sicilian influence. <br><br> St. Louis pizza features Provel cheese and a sweeter tomato sauce with a hefty dosage of oregano. Because of its firm crust, St. Louis-style pizza can support several toppings of your choice. </p>
								</div>
								<div>
								<h4>Neapolitan</h4>
									<p>Neapolitan is the original pizza. This delicious pie dates all the way back to 18th century in Naples, Italy. During this time, the poorer citizens of this seaside city frequently purchased food that was cheap and could be eaten quickly. Luckily for them, Neapolitan pizza was affordable and readily available through numerous street vendors. <br><br> The typical Neapolitan pizza toppings are fresh mozzarella, tomatoes, basil leaves, oregano, and olive oil. Since Neapolitan pizza is thin, it isn't designed to handle the weight of too many toppings. In fact, Neapolitan pizza is so thin that it's typically eaten with a fork and knife. </p>

							<h3>Thick Crusts</h3>
								<div>
								<h4>Stuffed</h4>
									<p>Stuffed crust pizza is exactly what it sounds like –  sandwiching toppings between two layers of dough and then topping with cheese, however it is much more famously reflected through stuffing cheese into the outer edge of the crust and creating a top layer of dough to rest just on top of it. This is type of piece that’s actually best enjoyed crust side first! </p>
								</div>
								<div>
								<h4>Sicilian</h4>
									<p>Sicilian pizza, also known as "sfincione," provides a thick cut of pizza with pillowy dough, a crunchy crust, and robust tomato sauce. This square-cut pizza is served with or without cheese, and often with the cheese underneath the sauce to prevent the pie from becoming soggy. Sicilian pizza was brought to America in the 19th century by Sicilian immigrants and became popular in the United States after the Second World War. <br><br> Sicilian pizzas are often topped with bits of tomato, onion, anchovies, and herbs.</p>
								</div>
								<div>
								<h4>Chicago</h4>
									<p> Chicago pizza, also commonly referred to as deep-dish pizza, gets its name from the city it was invented in. During the early 1900’s, Italian immigrants in the windy city were searching for something similar to the Neapolitan pizza that they knew and loved. Instead of imitating the notoriously thin pie, Ike Sewell had something else in mind. He created a pizza with a thick crust that had raised edges, similar to a pie, and ingredients in reverse, with slices of mozzarella lining the dough followed by meat, vegetables, and then topped with a can of crushed tomatoes. This original creation led Sewell to create the now famous chain restaurant, Pizzeria Uno. <br><br> Generally, the toppings for Chicago pizza are ground beef, sausage, pepperoni, onion, mushrooms, and green peppers, placed underneath the tomato sauce. Some locations will finish off their pizzas with a sprinkle of Parmesan cheese across the tomato sauce.  </p>
								</div>
								<div>
								<h4>Greek</h4>
									<p> Greek pizza was created by Greek immigrants who came to America and were introduced to Italian pizza. Greek-style pizza, especially popular in the New England states, features a thick and chewy crust cooked in shallow, oiled pans, resulting in a nearly deep-fried bottom. While this style has a crust that is puffier and chewier than thin crust pizzas, it’s not quite as thick as a deep-dish or Sicilian crust. <br><br> Greek pizza is usually heavier on the sauce than the cheese. The sauce typically has a tangy tomato paste with a strong oregano flavor. It is often only topped with cheese, which is usually a mix of mozzarella and cheddar or provolone. It may feature a variety of non-Greek or Greek toppings, such as feta cheese, black olives, and red onion. .</p>
								</div>
								<div>
								<h4>Detroit</h4>
									<p>Reflecting the city’s deep ties to the auto industry, Detroit-style pizza was originally baked in a square automotive parts pan in the 1940’s. Detroit pizza is first topped with pepperoni, followed by brick cheese which is spread to the very edges of the pan, yielding a caramelized cheese perimeter. Sauce is then spooned over the pizza, an order similar to Chicago-style pizza. This pizza features a thick, extra crispy crust that is tender and airy on the inside. <br><br> Detroit pizza traditionally features pepperoni, brick cheese (usually Wisconsin brick cheese), and tomato sauce. Other typical toppings include mushrooms and olives. </p>

							<h3>Custom Crusts</h3>
								<div>
								<h4>Gluten Free</h4>
									<p>As people are becoming more aware gluten insensitivity and Celiac disease, so to is the food industry. Gluten-free pizza doughs are comprised of standard ingredients like water and yeast, but are bound with gluten-free flour. A flour is considered gluten-free if it is not the byproduct of wheat or barley, which as it turns out describes a ton of different ingredients! Flours for gluten-free pizza dough can be made typically from soy, rice, garbanzo beans, tapioca, and multiple combinations between them. Compared to crusts made with wheat flour, a gluten-free crust is likely to be considerably denser and less pliable, meaning for practical reasons that they are designed almost exclusively for thin crust pizzas; the texture is unique, but its crunch is reminiscent of a St. Louis style crust.</p>
								</div>
								<div>
								<h4>Whole Wheat</h4>
									<p>A whole grain, also called a wholegrain, is a grain of any cereal and pseudocereal that contains the endosperm, germ, and bran, in contrast to refined grains, which retain only the endosperm. So, as part of a general healthy diet, consumption of whole grains is associated with lower risk of several diseases. Therefore, this crust made only with whole wheat flour and usually has thin crust.</p>
								</div>
								<div>
								<h4>Multigrain</h4>
									<p>A multigrain crust is prepared with two or more types of grain. Grains used include barley, flax, millet, oats, wheat, and whole-wheat flour, among others. Some varieties include edible seeds in their preparation, such as flaxseed, quinoa, pumpkin seeds, and sunflower seeds; although it does not necessarily contain whole grains. Due to all the different types of flours, grains, and seeds (if desired) it will provide a different, unique flavor to the crust.</p>
								</div>
								<div>
								<h4>Vegan</h4>
									<p>A vegan-friendly pizza crust is easier to attain with the same traditional pizza dough ingredients compared to the gluten-free variety. A Neapolitan pizza crust, for example, is already vegan due to it not containing any byproducts from animals. However, given that cheese is substituted due to it being a dairy product, the crust usually has to bear more of the burden to provide flavor. <br><br>Consequently, vegan-friendly crusts will make greater use out of flavored oils and herbs to flavor the crust. On the upside, the back end of the crust when the slice is finished will sure to be extra tasty! For vegans wanting to try a variant of the cauliflower based gluten free crust, consider substituting parmesan cheese with nutritional yeast.  </p>
