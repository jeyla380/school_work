    "### Scenario:\n",
    "The Western Governors University Parcel Service (WGUPS) needs to determine an efficient route and delivery distribution for their Daily Local Deliveries (DLD) because packages are not currently being consistently delivered by their promised deadline. The Salt Lake City DLD route has **three trucks**, **two drivers**, and **an average of 40 packages to deliver** each day. Each package has specific criteria and delivery requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to determine an algorithm, write code, and present a solution where all 40 packages (listed in the attached “WGUPS Package File”) will be delivered on time while meeting each package’s requirements and **keeping the combined total distance traveled under 140 miles for both trucks**. The specific delivery locations are shown on the attached “Salt Lake City Downtown Map,” and distances to each location are given in the attached “WGUPS Distance Table.” The intent is to use the program for this specific location and also for many other cities in each state where WGU has a presence. As such, you will need to include detailed comments to make your code easy to follow and to justify the decisions you made while writing your scripts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep in mind that the supervisor should be able to see, at assigned points, the progress of each truck and its packages by any of the variables listed in the “WGUPS Package File,” including what has been delivered and at what time the delivery occurred.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assumptions:\n",
    "- Each truck can carry a maximum of 16 packages, and the ID number of each package is unique.\n",
    "- The trucks travel at an average speed of 18 miles per hour and have an infinite amount of gas with no need to stop.\n",
    "- There are no collisions.\n",
    "- Three trucks and two drivers are available for deliveries. Each driver stays with the same truck as long as that truck is in service.\n",
    "- Drivers leave the hub no earlier than 8:00 a.m., with the truck loaded, and can return to the hub for packages if needed. \n",
    "- The delivery and loading times are instantaneous, i.e., no time passes while at a delivery or when moving packages to a truck at the hub (that time is factored into the calculation of the average speed of the trucks).\n",
    "- There is up to one special note associated with a package.\n",
    "- The delivery address for package #9, Third District Juvenile Court, is wrong and will be corrected at 10:20 a.m. WGUPS is aware that the address is incorrect and will be updated at 10:20 a.m. However, WGUPS does not know the correct address (410 S State St., Salt Lake City, UT 84111) until 10:20 a.m.\n",
    "- The distances provided in the WGUPS Distance Table are equal regardless of the direction traveled.\n",
    "- The day ends when all 40 packages have been delivered.\n",
    "\n",
    "**EOD = End of Day\n"

The algorithm shouldn't have any issue being able to compile and run additional data as the algorithm takes the location data from the packages to run. The data structure ideally shouldn't have any issues, but it depends on the information of the packages. Truck one takes packages that need to be delivered by 10:30am (more specifically 9:00am and 10:30am), truck two and truck three have the packages divided between them (unless the packages suggest specific trucks) by having truck two contain the rest of the even packages, and truck three containing the odd.

Unless there were thousands of packages, then the function might slow down when searching through the dictionary, but it should still work properly."

Luckily the packages should spread evenly between the buckets, but if there's too many packages in a bucket it can heavily affect the space. To fix this, all that needs to be done is to set the data structure size to something much larger."

With adding more trucks, some trucks could focus on later delivery times, or could split the packages using the modulo `%` to split packages by the number of trucks. Adding the additional trucks wouldn't affect the look-up time as the look-up function only looks up packages, and it shouldn't affect the space usage in a negative way, in fact it should help reduce space usage by splitting the packages up instead of having three trucks holding a lot of packages.\n",

This can be both be advantageous or disadvantageous as it allows you to change the keys or values, but it also means that if there are multiple keys that are the same variable, the value will be replaced each time.\n",
    "    - Dictionaries are able to contain multiple data types for both keys and values, with the exception of lists. Dictionary keys can be strings, integers, boolean, etc., but can't be a list. Dictionary values can be the same as dictionary keys: strings, integers, boolean, etc, but can also be a list that contains multiple data types as well.\n",

    "    - Just like dictionaries, lists are mutable; but unlike dictionaries, lists are altered by using the list index as compared to the key, value pair. Personally, it is a easier to view data in a list within a for-loop than it is using a dictionary.\n",
    "    - Another big difference from dictionaires is that lists can contain duplicates, while dictionaries will overwrite the value if there are duplicate keys. This can be an advantage if a program that is being created may have duplicate values, such as a grocery list. "
