She continued to see him in disregard of my advice.
She demanded that I should help him.
She dared to call on him.
She gave him the elbow yesterday.
She ended up getting married to him.
She married him last year.
She dreaded having to tell him what had happened.
She never dreamed she'd meet him in a foreign country.
She telephoned him that she couldn't attend the meeting.
She soon came to believe him.
She still loved him.
"She called out to him, with tears running down her cheeks."
She got so carried away listening to the Beatles that she missed the date with him.
